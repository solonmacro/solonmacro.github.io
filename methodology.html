  <h1>Methodology</h1>

  <p>
    SolonInsight is designed to track <strong>systemic risk</strong> using a small set of
    high-signal indicators. The goal is not to predict exact market tops or bottoms, but to
    identify when risk conditions are <em>improving</em> or <em>deteriorating</em> in ways that have
    historically mattered for financial stability.
  </p>

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Focus on leading indicators:</strong> credit conditions and liquidity tend to move before equities.</li>
    <li><strong>Prefer changes over levels:</strong> trends and inflections often matter more than absolute values.</li>
    <li><strong>Use simple, explicit rules:</strong> thresholds are transparent and can be independently verified.</li>
    <li><strong>Separate signal from noise:</strong> the dashboard is updated on schedules that match each dataset (daily/weekly/monthly).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Indicator Groups</h2>

  <h3>1) Credit & Funding Conditions (Highest Priority)</h3>
  <p>
    Credit markets often price stress earlier than equity indices. Widening spreads,
    tightening lending standards, and signs of refinancing pressure can indicate that the
    marginal borrower is under strain.
  </p>

  <h3>2) Labor Market</h3>
  <p>
    The labor market influences consumption and default risk. Inflections in unemployment
    or jobless claims can signal that economic momentum is weakening. Labor indicators can
    be lagging, so they are interpreted together with credit conditions.
  </p>

  <h3>3) Liquidity & Monetary Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Liquidity conditions affect risk appetite and funding availability. Cha
